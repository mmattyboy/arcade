Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

The simple game, Frogger, requires the player to control the character with the keyboard: up, down, left, and right. The objective of the game is to successfully make the player cross to the river without bumping into any of the bugs. When the player gets to the river, the game resets, the player is placed back to the starting position.
